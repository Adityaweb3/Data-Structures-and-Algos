// You are given a binary search tree (BST) and a key value 'K'. You need to delete the node with value 'K'. 
// It is guaranteed that a node has the value 'K'.

// // A binary search tree (BST), also called an ordered or sorted binary tree, is a rooted binary tree whose internal nodes each store a key greater than all the keys in the node's 
// left subtree and less than those in its right subtree.
